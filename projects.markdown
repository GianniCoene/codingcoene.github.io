<h3>Jam Search</h3>

If you're familiar with the Tindr app, then you'll know what this does. Jam Search is a progressive web app, the user can use this app to get random songs and then decide to either add the song
to a playlist if they like it, or blacklist it if they don't like it.

The user could create an account and log-in and see all of the saved songs and all of the blacklisted songs.


<h3>International Project</h3>

I worked together with three students of the Helmo school in Li√®ge. The difficulty of this project was not the project itself but the language barrier as they could not speak Dutch
while my French was not all too great either. We communicated in English for the entire project.
The project itself was rather easy. We made a WPF application that users could use to search people in a database and assign tickets to the selected person. That person could
use the ticket to pick up a meal.


<h3>Walk-by</h3>

As part of our cloud development module we had to create a cloud based application. This could be anything we chose. I chose to create an application that allowed users to create
and login to their account. Once logged in they could add locations using markers on a world map for every other user to see. These locations could be anything they wanted from must-see sights to important
monuments.

All of this data was stored on a cloud database using google cloud.

<h3>Dominion</h3>

My first school project was a group project. Our objective was to create a digital version of the card game "Dominion". This was a strategy card game with lots of
different cards that each had unique actions. This was a very fun project to work on and my first real experience with how programming goes. We had a very slow start and it was a
real eye opener for us as we continually ran into problems we had to fix on our own.

<h3>Geometry Wars</h3>

My second school project is the one I enjoyed the most. This was the closest we could get to real game development. We had to come up with a business plan on how to sell our game.
This included micro transactions, price of the game itself, potential DLC. Other than a business plan we also had to consider our costs. We had to rent a building, pay for electricity, water,
employees, ...
We made the game engine from scratch only using a Java library to make it a little bit easier.
We designed every aspect of the game using the realy Geometry Wars as reference.

<h3>FabLab Howest</h3>

For my third and final school project we had to make a website with a connected reservation system and a smart lock made using an Arduino and NodeMCU.
People could visit the website, login using their account and make reservations for different machines including 3D-printer, lasercutters, ...
The smart lock was there to prevent unauthorized access. This means that people could only go into the workshop when they had made a reservation and if they had an access card.
This project focused more on real life projects and communication with the customer.
